// PART 1, EXERCISE 9
// The team of 10 people is working on a project. The first teammate worked for 6 hours. Every next collaborator
// spent 10 minutes more than the previous one. Return the total payment they all will get,
// considering the rate of $65/hour.
// Return example: 3827.34

export function getTotalTeamPayment() {
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part1-9"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
