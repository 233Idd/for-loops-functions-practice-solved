// PART 1, EXERCISE 4
// Return a sum on numbers ( :number ) that can be divided by 7 in 0..100
// Return example: 72

export function getNumbersSumInAHundred() {
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part1-4"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
