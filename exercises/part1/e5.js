// PART 1, EXERCISE 5
// Return an array of all even numbers in 0..50 ( :[number] )
// Return example: [0, 1, 2, ..., 50]

export function getEvenNumbers() {
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part1-5"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
