// PART 1, EXERCISE 8
// You have borrowed your friend a $1000 with 5% monthly interest. Return an array ( :[number] ) of monthly debt values
// if your friend decides to return the full loan with interest in 3, 5 and 9 and 12 months.
// Return example: [0, 1, 2, ..., n]

export function getTotalDebtValue() {
  const arrPeriods = [3, 5, 9, 12];
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part1-8"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
