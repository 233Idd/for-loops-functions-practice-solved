// PART 2, EXERCISE 10
// The difference between the sum of atm fills and withdrawals is not equal to balance for one of the clients.
// Return an array of the client's name and difference value or 'All balances are fine' string
// Return example: ['Name', 453]

export function getClientWithWrongBalance(bankAccounts) {
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part2-10"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
