import { bankAccounts } from "../../data/data";

// PART 2, EXERCISE 9
// Return an array of withdrawal sums of each client from the given data structure
// Return example: [3432, 43242.34, 23432]

export function getAllWithdrawals(bankAccounts) {
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part2-9"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
