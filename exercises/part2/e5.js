// PART 2, EXERCISE 5
// Return an array of clients data with balance over $100 from the given data structure
// Return example: [{name: '', balance: 32, ...}, {name: '', balance: 3523, ...}]

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part2-5"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
