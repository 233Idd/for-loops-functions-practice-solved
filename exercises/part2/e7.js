import { bankAccounts } from "../../data/data";

// PART 2, EXERCISE 7
// Return Phil's balance after they have added $100 from the given data structure
// Return example: 2343.23

export function getPhilsNewBalance(bankAccounts) {
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part2-7"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
