// PART 2, EXERCISE 4
// Return the name of the client with the greatest balance value from the given data structure
// Return example: 'Kevin'

export function getClientWithGreatestBalance(bankAccounts) {
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part2-4"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
