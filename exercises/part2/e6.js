import { bankAccounts } from "../../data/data";

// PART 2, EXERCISE 6
// Return an array of clients names that have a given letter in their name from the given data structure
// Arguments example: (bankAccounts, 'e')
// Return example: ['Kevin', 'Steven']

export function getClientsWithLetterInName(bankAccounts, letter) {
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part2-6"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
