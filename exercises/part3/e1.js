import { classSeats } from '../../data/data';

// PART 3, EXERCISE 1
// Return a boolean that states if there is a seat for Kevin in the class from the given data structure
// Return example: true

export function isKevinInClass(classSeats) {
  // Your code goes here...

}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part3-1"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
