import { classSeats } from '../../data/data';

// PART 3, EXERCISE 4
// Student Evelyn is not in class today. Find her seat in the given data structure and make it an empty string.
// Return a new value of the row she was in.
// Return example: ['Name', '', 'Name']

export function makeStudentsSeatEmpty(classSeats) {
  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-part3-4"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
